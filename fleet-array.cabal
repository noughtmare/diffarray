synopsis: Fleet arrays are pure, but support fast updates if used linearly
tested-with: GHC ==9.10.1 || ==9.8.4 || ==9.6.6
description:
  Updating a pure array in Haskell usually requires copying the whole array,
  which takes linear time. For constant-time array updates, you would need to
  use a monadic interface, manually specifying the order of evaluation.  Fleet
  arrays strike a balance between these two extremes. In common usage patterns,
  where old versions of arrays not reused after they are updated, fleet arrays
  support constant time indexing and updates. Accessing old versions does incur
  performance overhead. We hope this package can form the basis of a pure
  and performant array library.

  Fleet arrays can be more than 10x faster than 'IntMap' if used densly and
  linearly.
